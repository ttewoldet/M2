                        I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is
                        no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep
                        your eyes close.

                        crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and
